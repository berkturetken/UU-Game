SOME IMPORTANT THINGS

1) In the main menu, if you input a invalid number like 4, it asks us to input a valid input again. BUT if you input a invalid number again,the program terminates. 
---> I think, it should ask until getting a valid input.

2) In the Play vs. Human part, we can prompt names of the player while they're playing (To be able to do that, we can ask to the users to input a name before the game starts).
Otherwise, you have to follow the game on your own and it can be hard for you sometimes.
---> If the names are shown on the screen, that would be pretty good.

3) While playing the game, a player can place a piece which is already occupied from another piece.
---> MOST IMPORTANT THING, I guess. The player should not place a piece in that case and we can prompt some error message and ask to the player for another place to be placed.

4) X & Y coordinates are wrong :) 
---> X & Y coordinates should interchange. When you enter a valid number for X, it behaves like in the Y coordinate.
