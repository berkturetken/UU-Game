1) Why isn't there any option to add 8 AI to the local tournament? (We have 0-3 options to select number of AIs)

2) How many AI units? -> If I press two times wrongly, it gives errors... (photo on the photo)
   --> There should be a loop, I guess
3) How many players? -> If I press two times wrongly, it gives errors... 
   --> There should be a loop, I guess
4) No option to select AI's difficulty levels in the tournament
.
5) Better viewing below... (photo on the phone)

6) After the tournament finishes, it goes back to the beginning of the tournament screen which shows "How many players?" part.
   -->There should be a screen who wins that final round and also a table for the whole tournament again as a last screen for the tournament

7) To play again, what key do I have to press? Because I quit every time whatever I press...
8) While playing online versus, if a player types "quit", we get this prompt in the other terminal (photo on the phone)

9) While booting the server for online game versus, there are some errors (photo on the photo)
